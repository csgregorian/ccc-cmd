Problem J4/S2: Spirals
A spiral of numbers can start and end with any positive integers less than 100. Write a program which will accept two positive integers x and y as input, and output a list of numbers from x to y inclusive, shown in a spiral. You may assume that the end value is greater than or equal to the start value.
A spiral starts with the first number in the centre. The next number appears immediately below the first number. The spiral continues with the numbers increasing in a counter-clockwise direction until the last number is printed.
