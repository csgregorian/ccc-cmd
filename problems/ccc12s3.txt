Problem S3: Absolutely Acidic
You are gathering readings of acidity level in a very long river in order
to determine the health of the river. You have placed N sensors in
the river, and each sensor gives an integer reading R. For the
purposes of your research, you would like to know the frequency of each
reading, and find the absolute difference between the two most frequent
readings.
If there are more than two readings that have the highest frequency, the
difference computed should be the largest such absolute difference
between two readings with this frequency. If there is only one reading with
the largest frequency, but more than one reading with the second largest
frequency, the difference computed should be the largest absolute
difference between the most frequently occurring reading and any of the
readings which occur with second-highest frequency.

Input Format
The first line of input will be the integer N
(2 ≤ N ≤ 2×106), the
number of sensors. The next N lines each contain the reading for
that sensor, which is an integer R
(1 ≤ R ≤ 1000). You should assume that
there are at least two different readings in the input.

Output Format

Output the positive integer value representing the absolute difference
between the two most frequently occurring readings, subject to the tie-breaking
rules outlined above.
