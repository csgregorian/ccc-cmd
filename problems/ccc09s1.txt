Problem S1: Cool Numbers
Eric likes interesting numbers like 64. It turns out that 64 is both a square and a cube, since 64 = 82 and 64 = 43. Eric calls these numbers cool. Write a program that helps Eric figure out how many integers in a given range are cool.

Input
On the first line of input, you are given an integer a such that a ≥ 1 and a ≤ 108. On the second line of input, you are given an integer b such that b ≥ a and b ≤ 108.

Output
The output should be the number of cool numbers in the range a to b (inclusively: that is, a and b would count as cool numbers in the range if they were actually cool).
