Problem S1: Snow Calls
You've been snowed in at your summer residence. And without the Internet! Unfortunately, this means you're going to have rely on using the phone to get what you need to survive: pizza, pop, and the latest video games.
Often times, companies replace the digits in their phone numbers with characters to make their phone numbers more memorable. Because apparently, it's easier to remember 416-BUY-MORE than it is to remember 416-289-6673. Some companies even add extra digits or characters (like 604-PIZZABOX) but any digits after the 10th are irrelevant.
Since it's getting tedious to do the conversion by hand, write a program to help change all the phone numbers in your phone book to the form xxx-xxx-xxxx, using the below image to assist you.


Input

Input consists of a series of test cases. The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. Following this are t lines consisting of alpha-numeric characters separated by hyphens, representing valid phone numbers. All letters will be in uppercase. No line is longer than 40 characters.

Output
For each test case, output the phone number in the form xxx-xxx-xxxx to the screen.
