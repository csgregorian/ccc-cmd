Problem S5: Factor Solitare
In the game of Factor Solitaire, you start with the number 1, and try to
change it to some given target number n by repeatedly using the
following operation. In each step, if c is your current number, you
split it into two positive factors a, b of your
choice such that
c = a * b.  You then add
a to your current number c to get your new current
number. Doing this costs you b points.  You continue doing this
until your current number is n, and you try to achieve this at the
cost of a minimum total number of points.
For example, here is one way to get to 15:

start with 1
change 1 to 1+1=2—cost so far is 1
change 2 to 2+1=3—cost so far is 1+2
change 3 to 3+3=6—cost so far is 1+2+1
change 6 to 6+6=12—cost so far is 1+2+1+1
change 12 to 12+3=15—cost so far is 1+2+1+1+4=9.

In fact, this is the minimum possible total cost to get 15. You want to
compute the minimum total cost for other target end numbers.

Input
The input costs of a single integer N ≥ 1. In at
least half of the cases N ≤ 5×104, in
at least another quarter of the cases
N ≤ 5×105, and in the remaining cases
N ≤ 5×106.

Output
Compute the minimum cost that gets you to N.

Sample Input 1
15

Sample Output 1
9

Sample Input 2
2013

Sample Output 2
91

Sample Case 2
For example, start with 1, then get to 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 61, 122,
244, 305, 610, 671, 1342, and then 2013.
