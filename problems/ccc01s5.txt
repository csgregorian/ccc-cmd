2001 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1

Problem S5: Post's Correspondence Problem
Let A and B be two sequences of non-empty strings:
  A = (a1, a2, ..., an), B = (b1, b2, ..., bn).
  Let m be a positive integer. Does there exist a sequence of integers
  i1, i2, ..., ik such that m > k > 0 and ai1ai2...aik = 
  bi1bi2...bik?
 
  For example, if A = (a, abaaa, ab) and B = (aaa, ab, b), then the required sequence of integers is (2,1,1,3) giving  abaaaaaab = abaaaaaab.

Input
The first two lines of input will contain m and n respectively, and m x  n â‰¤ 40. The next 2n lines contain in order the elements of A followed by the elements of B. Each string is at most 20 characters.

Output
If a solution exists, print k on a line by itself, followed by the integer sequence in order, one element per line. Otherwise, print a single line containing "No solution."
