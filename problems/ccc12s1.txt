2012 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1

Problem S1: Don't pass me the ball!
A CCC soccer game operates under slightly different soccer rules. A goal is
only counted if the 4 players, in order, who touched the ball prior to the goal
have jersey numbers that are in ascending numeric order with the highest number
being the goal-scorer.
Players have jerseys numbered from 1 to 99 (and each jersey number is worn
by exactly one player).
Given a jersey number of the goal-scorer, indicate how many possible
combinations of players can produce a valid goal.

Input Format
The input will be the positive integer J
(J ≤ 99), which is the jersey number of the goal
scorer.

Output Format
The output will be one line containing the number of possible scoring
combinations that could have J as the goal-scoring jersey
number.
