2013 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1

Problem J3/S1: From 1987 to 2013
You might be surprised to know that 2013 is the first year since 1987 with
distinct digits. The years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 each have
distinct digits. 2012 does not have distinct digits, since the digit 2 is
repeated.
Given a year, what is the next year with distinct digits?

Input
The input consists of one integer Y
(0 ≤ Y ≤ 10000), representing the starting
year.

Output
The output will be the single integer D, which is the next year
after Y with distinct digits.
