2000 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1Problem J3/S1: Slot Machines Martha takes a jar of quarters to the casinowith the intention of becoming rich. She plays three machines in turn. Unknownto her, the machines are entirely predictable. Each play costs one quarter. Thefirst machine pays 30 quarters every 35th time it is played; the second machinepays 60 quarters every 100th time it is played; the third pays 9 quarters every10th time it is played. Your program should take as input the numberof quarters in Martha's jar (there will be at least one and fewer than 1000), andthe number of times each machine has been played since it last paid. Your program should output the number of times Martha plays until she goes broke. Sample Input483104 Sample OutputMartha plays 66 times before going broke.
