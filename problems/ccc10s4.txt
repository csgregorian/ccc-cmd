Problem S4: Animal Farm
You are running a farm which has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100)
animals. You went to the store and bought M = N pre-made
pens that will house your animals. Pens satisfy the following conditions:

pens have between 3 and 8 edges;
an edge that is specified by two pens connects the two pens;
an edge that is specified only once connects that pen to the outside;
there is exactly one animal in each pen and no animals outside the pens,
initially.

The animals, however, have a game they like to play called "Escape from the
pen." They assign a cost to each edge of the pen, and they determine the
minimum cost for all of the animals to meet in the same area by trampling over
the edge of various pens. The animals may meet inside a particular pen or
outside of all the pens. Also note that once an edge has been trampled, any
animal may pass over it without incurring any cost.
You will be given a description of the pens, along with the placement of
animals, and you are to figure out what the smallest cost is to move all the
animals into the same area.

Input
The first line of input will be the integer M, the number of pens.
On the next M lines, there will be a description of each pen, with
one description per line. The description is composed of three components, with
each component separated by one space, as follows:

the first component is an integer ep (3 ≤
ep), which describes the number of edges for this
particular pen p;
the second component is a sequence of ep integers
describing the corners of each pen, where each integer is less than or equal
to 1000;
the third component is a sequence of ep integers
describing the cost of each edge, where each integer is less than or equal to
5000.

For the corner and edge cost description, the descriptions are given in
cyclical order. For example, the pen description "3 1 2 3 7 4 6" means that
there are three corners, and thus, three edges, where the edge (1,2) has cost
7, the edge (2,3) has cost 4 and the edge (3,1) has cost 6. Note: at least 20%
of the marks for this question have N ≤ 10 and no pen will have
more than four edges in these cases.

Output
On one line, output the minimal cost that will allow all the animals to
gather in one pen or outside all of the pens.

Sample Input

3 1 2 3 7 4 6
4 1 2 4 5 7 7 2 6
4 4 7 6 5 4 8 9 2
5 3 2 4 7 8 4 7 4 7 7

Sample Output
10
Explanation
The diagram below explains the input data:

where the circled numbers are the corners, and the numbers in italics
are the edge costs. Notice that if the edges (2,3), (4,5), and (4,7) are
removed, all the animals can meet in the pen which has five sides.
