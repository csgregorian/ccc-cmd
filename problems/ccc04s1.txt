2004 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1

Problem S1: Fix
A collection of words is prefix-free if no word is a prefix of any other word.
A collection of words is suffix-free if no word is a suffix of any other word.
A collection of words is fix-free if it is both prefix-free and suffix-free.
For this problem, a word is a sequence of lower-case letters of length between 1 and 25.
A word X is a prefix of word Y if X consists of the first n characters of Y, in order,
for some n.  That is, the word "cat" has prefixes "c", "ca", and "cat".
Similarly, a word X is a suffix of Y if X consists of the last n characters of Y, in order,
for some n.

Input
The input will be 3N+1 lines: the first line will be the number N,
and the remaining 3N lines will be the N collections of 3 words each. 
(That is, lines 2, 3, and 4 compose the first collection, lines 5, 6, and 7 compose the second collection, and so on).

Output
Your output will be N lines, each line containing either Yes (if that collection of words is fix-free) or No (if that collection is not fix-free).
