Problem S3: Maze
In order to make a few dollars, you have decided to become part of a scientific experiment. You
are fed lots of pizza, then more pizza and then you are asked to find your way across the city on a
scooter powered only by pizza. Of course, the city has lots of intersections, and these intersections
are very controlled. Some intersections are forbidden for you to enter; some only let you move
north/south as you leave the intersection; others let you move only east/west as you leave the
intersection; and the rest let you go in any compass direction (north, south, east or west).
Thankfully your scientific friends have given you a map of the city (on the back of a pizza box),
with an arrangement of symbols indicating how you can move around the city. Specifically, there
are 4 different symbols on the box:

The symbol + indicates we can move in any direction (north/south/east/west) from this location.
The symbol - indicates we can move only east or west from this location.
The symbol | indicates we can move only north or south from this location.
The symbol * indicates we cannot occupy this location.

Your task is to determine how many intersections you must pass through to move from the northwest
corner of the city to the south-east corner of the city.

Input

The input begins with a number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) on its own line, which indicates how many different
cases are contained in this file. Each case begins with a number r on one line, followed by a number
c on the next line (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 20). The next r lines contain c characters, where each character is
one of {+, *, -, |}. You may assume the north-west corner of the city can be occupied (i.e., it will not be marked with *).

Output
The output will be t lines long, with one integer per line. The integer on line i (1 ≤ i ≤ t) indicates
the minimum number of intersections required to pass through as you move from the north-west
corner of the city to the south-east corner of the city. If there is no way to get from the north-west
corner to the south-east corner, output -1 for that test case.
