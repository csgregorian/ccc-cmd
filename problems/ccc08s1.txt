2008 Canadian Computing Competition, Stage 1

Problem S1: It's Cold Here!
Canada is cold in winter, but some parts are colder than others. Your task is very simple - you need
to find the coldest city in Canada. So, when given a list of cities and their temperatures, you are to
determine which city in the list has the lowest temperature and is thus the coldest.

Input
The input is a sequence of city names and temperature values. Temperatures are integer, possibly
preceded with a minus sign. There is a single space between the city name and the temperature.
No city name contains any whitespace and is always less than 256 characters in length. There is at
least one city in the list, no more than 10000 cities, and the last city is always Waterloo. You may
assume that the temperature is not less than -273 and not more than 200.

Output
You are to output the name of the coldest city on a single line with no whitespace before or after
the name. You may assume that there will not be more than one city which is the coldest.

Sample Input
Saskatoon -20
Toronto -2
Winnipeg -40
Vancouver 8
Halifax 0
Montreal -4
Waterloo -3

Sample Output
Winnipeg
