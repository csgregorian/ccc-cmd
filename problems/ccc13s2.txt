Problem S2: Bridge transport
A train of railway cars attempts to cross a bridge. The length of each car
is 10 m but their weights might be different. The bridge is 40 m long
(thus can hold 4 train cars at one time). The bridge will crack if the total
weight of the cars on it at one time is greater than a certain weight. The cars
are numbered starting at 1, going up to N, and they cross the bridge
in that order (i.e., 1 immediately followed by 2, which is immediately followed
by 3, and so on).
What is the largest number T of railway cars such that the train
of cars 1…T (in order) can cross the bridge?

Input
The first line of input is the maximum weight W
(1 ≤ W ≤ 100000) that the bridge can hold at any
particular time. The second line of input is the number N
(1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) which is the number of railway cars
that we wish to move across the bridge. On each of the next N lines
of input, there will be a positive integer wi
(1 ≤ i ≤ N,
1 ≤ wi ≤ 100000) which
represents the weight of the ith railway car in the
sequence.

Output
Your output should be a non-negative integer representing the maximum number
of railway cars that can be brought across the bridge in the order
specified.

Sample Output 1
5
Explanation
The first four railway cars have total weight 50 + 30 + 10 + 10 = 100, which
is not greater than what the bridge can hold. When the first railway car
leaves, and the next comes on, we have a total weight of 30 + 10 + 10 + 40 =
90, which is not greater than what the bridge can hold. The last four cars
would cause the bridge to break, since 10 + 10 + 40 + 50 = 110 which is greater
than the bridge can hold. So, only the first 5 railway cars can be taken across
the bridge.

Sample Input 2
100
3
150

1

Sample Output 2
0
Explanation
When the first railway car enters the bridge, its weight of 150 will exceed
the maximum weight the bridge can hold. Thus, we cannot bring any railway cars
across the bridge.
