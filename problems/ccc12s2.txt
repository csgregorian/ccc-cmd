Problem S2: Aromatic Numbers
This question involves calculating the value of aromatic numbers
which are a combination of Arabic digits and Roman numerals.
An aromatic number is of the form ARARAR...AR, where
each A is an Arabic digit, and each R is a Roman
numeral. Each pair AR contributes a value described below, and by
adding or subtracting these values together we get the value of the entire
aromatic number.
An Arabic digit A, can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. A
Roman numeral R is one of the seven letters I, V, X, L, C, D, or M.
Each Roman numeral has a base value:

SymbolIVXLCD
M
Base value151050100
5001000

The value of a pair AR is A times the base value of
R. Normally, you add up the values of the pairs to get the overall
value. However, wherever there are consecutive symbols ARA'R' with
R' having a strictly bigger base value than R,
the value of pair AR must be subtracted from the total,
instead of being added.
For example, the number 3M1D2C has the value
3×1000 + 1×500 + 2*100 = 3700 and
3X2I4X has the value
3×10 - 2×1 + 4×10 = 68.
Write a program that computes the values of aromatic numbers.
