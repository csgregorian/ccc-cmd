 Problem S4: Substrings How many distinct substrings does a given string S have? For example, if S = "abc", S has 7 distinct substrings: "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc". Note that the empty string and S itself are considered substrings of s. On the other hand, if S = "aaa". S has only 4 distinct substrings: "", "a", "aa", "aaa". Input The first line of the input file contains N, the number of test cases. For each test case, a linefollows giving S, a string of from 1 to 5000 alphanumeric characters. Output Your output consists of one line per case, giving the number of distinct substrings of S. Grading50% of test cases will have l (the length of the string) ≤ 1,000.For all cases, l ≤ 5000.
