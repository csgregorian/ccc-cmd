Problem S3: Alice Through the Looking Glass
Alice is looking at a crystal through a microscope. Alice’s microscope has the interesting feature
that it can superimpose grid lines over the image that she is looking at.
At level 1 of magnification, Alice sees the image as follows:

Notice that at level 1, there is a 5 × 5 grid superimposed over the image.
However, as Alice increases the magnification, the leaf pattern becomes more intricate.

At level 2 of the magnification, Alice sees the image with a 25 × 25 grid, and notices that three of
the four larger squares in the original image have the small four square pattern on top. In fact, for
this particular crystal, this self-similarity repeats for each magnification level.
Given that Alice's microscope has up to 13 levels of magnification, she would like to try to quantify the detail of each grid cell at every one of these magnification levels.
Specifically, since there is a 5m × 5m grid at magnification level m, Alice will call the bottom-left
corner grid cell (0, 0), the bottom-right grid cell (5m − 1, 0), the top-left grid cell (0, 5m − 1), and
the top-right grid cell (5m − 1, 5m − 1).
Given an integer magnification level and a grid position, Alice would like to know if her crystal will fill that grid cell, or if that grid cell will be empty space.

Input Format
The first line of input will be T (0 < T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. On each of the next T lines there will be three integers: m (1 ≤ m ≤ 13), followed by x and y (0 ≤ x, y < 5m), the position of the grid cell that Alice wishes to examine.

Output Format
The output will be T lines. Each line of output will either be empty, if the specified grid cell is empty, or crystal if that grid cell contains crystal.
