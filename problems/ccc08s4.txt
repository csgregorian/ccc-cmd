Problem S4: Twenty-four
Twenty-four is a popular card game designed to be played by four players. Each
player is dealt a deck of cards, which are kept face down. On every turn, each
of the four players turns over the top card of his or her deck, so that it is visible
to all. The goal is to find an arithmetic expression using the values of the cards
(with A meaning 1, J meaning 11, Q meaning 12, and K meaning 13) that
evaluates to the number 24. For example, one possible expression would be:

((A * K)- J) * Q
((1*13)-11) * 12

The first player to find such an expression wins the turn, and adds all four cards to the bottom of
his or her deck.
Each valid arithmetic expression must use all four cards, and must combine their values using
addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Parentheses are allowed to specify precedence
of operations. Juxtaposing cards to make multiple-digit decimal numbers is not allowed (e.g. you
cannot place the cards 2 and 4 beside each other to make 24). Non-integer quotients of division
are also not allowed, even as a partial result (of a subexpression of the overall expression).
In some cases, the players may take a very long time to find an expression evaluating to 24. In fact,
in some cases, no such expression exists. Your task is to determine, given four cards, an expression
that evaluates to the largest number less than or equal to 24.

Input
The first line contains an integer 1 ≤ N ≤ 5 indicating the number of card hands that follow. Each
hand consists of four lines. Each of these lines is an integer 1 ≤ C ≤ 13 indicating the value of a card.

Output
For each hand, output a line containing an integer n if the cards can be combined using arithmetic
operators to evaluate to n. The value n should be the largest possible value amongst all possible
arithmetic expressions using these 4 cards, so long as n ≤ 24.
