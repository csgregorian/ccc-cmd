Problem J5/S3: Floor Plan
The floor plan of a house shows rooms separated by walls. This floor plan can be
transferred to a grid using the character "I" for walls and "." for room space.
Doorways are not shown. Each "I" or "." character occupies one square
metre.

In this diagram there are six rooms.
You have been given the floor plan of a house and a supply of hardwood flooring.
You are to determine how many rooms will have the flooring installed if you
start installing the floor in the largest room first and move to the next
largest room, and so on. You may not skip over any room, and you must stop when
you do not have enough wood for the next room. Output the number of rooms that
can have hardwood installed, and how many square metres of flooring are left
over.
No room will be larger than 64 square metres.
The first line of the input contains the number of square metres of flooring
you have. The second line in the input contains an integer r from 1 to 25 that
represents the number of rows in the grid. The third line contains an integer c
from 1 to 25 that represents the number of columns in the grid. The remaining r
lines contain c characters of grid data.
